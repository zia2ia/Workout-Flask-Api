# Workout Tracker API

## Overview

The Workout Tracker API is designed to help users manage their workout routines by storing various workout data such as workout type, name, weight, and reps. This API provides essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities, allowing users to interact with the workout data via a RESTful interface.

The API is built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, and SQLite, a serverless, self-contained database engine. The application ensures proper validation for data entries and includes features to enforce limits on workout repetitions and weight.
